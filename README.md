# ML Core Concepts

This repository contains hands-on implementations of core machine learning concepts using Python.

## Folder Structure
- `data/` → Datasets used across experiments
- `regression/` → Regression models and preprocessing notebooks

## Implemented Models
- Data Preprocessing
- Simple Linear Regression
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)

The goal of this repo is to understand core ML workflows by implementing models step by step rather than relying on automated pipelines.
